In order to run the main algorithm, run main.py.

If you wish to change the objective function or any variables, edit main.py using the idle and change any needed values.

The majority of technical code (the entire genetic algorithm) is contained within diffEvo.py, and is called from main.py



I referenced a few pieces of code that can be seen in the folders: testing, medium testing.
All pieces of code work and can be run if interested, however those pieces of code were run to test small functionalties of the main code.
